# Detecting-Depression-through-Tweets
The aim of this project is to build a deep learning model to classify Twitter users into different risk zones for depression based on their Tweets

## Week 1-2
* Text pre-processing
* Exploratory data analysis by plotting graphs and using tools like word cloud

## Week 3-4
* Creating LSTM model and analyzing accuracy
* Embedding layer using word2vec
* Creating Logistic regression model and comparing its performance with LSTM

## Tech-stack Used
Mainly Pandas, NLTK,Matplotlib, Numpy, Keras, Gensim, wordcloud, LSTM from keras.
